A security vulnerability in Travis CI exposed secrets of open source projects, giving perpetrators lateral access to thousands of organizations. Even worse, they didn’t care.

On the 7th, Felix Lange discovered that secure environment variables of all public repositories were injected into pull requests. This enables bad actors to access private servers and accounts, leveraging control of countless organizations.

After several days of pressure, this was finally patched, but in complete silence. Nothing was done to alert users that their secrets might have been stolen; Travis CI just swept the whole matter under the rug.
3 days later, after ultimatums from more projects, Travis CI posted a brief bulletin without addressing the severity and gravity of the issue.

8 days later, another response was made on their forum:

This is heavily dismissive and misleading of the issue, particularly of private repositories. Repository owners can allow and enable forks and still fall victim to this vulnerability.

Furthermore, `in this scenario, secrets that are still encrypted in the Travis CI database` is not relevant to the user — they’re impacted, regardless. This is a blatant attempt by Travis CI to downplay and mislead users away from their irresponsible handling of the issue.

Despite the vulnerability being patched, the issue of communicating the implications to users remains. With the response of `just recycle your keys`, we can only recommend abandoning Travis CI altogether and doing damage control in the aftermath of their ignorance.
